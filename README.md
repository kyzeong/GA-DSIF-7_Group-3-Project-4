### Problem Statement

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.
As a part of the data science team in National Environmental Agency (NEA) Singapore, we are tasked to predict of dengue cases in Singapore so that NEA can decide when and where to perform vector control such as pesticide spraying. Besides prediction of dengue cases, we are also looking into the cost-benefit analysis of pesticide spraying to maximize the benefit and lower the cost.
