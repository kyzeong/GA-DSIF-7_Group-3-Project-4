### Problem Statement

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.
As a part of the data science team in National Environmental Agency (NEA) Singapore, we are tasked to predict of dengue cases in Singapore so that NEA can decide when and where to perform vector control such as pesticide spraying. Besides prediction of dengue cases, we are also looking into the cost-benefit analysis of pesticide spraying to maximize the benefit and lower the cost.

### Data

The data is collected from a few sources as listed below.

* Singapore daily climate historical data ([source](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/))
* Google trend of various search term ([source](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=SG&q=%2Fm%2F09wsg))
* Dengue clusters in Singapore ([source](https://outbreak.sgcharts.com/data))

### Summary



---

### Conclusion
Historically, the top three estates with the most number of dengue cases are:
1. Chai Chee
2. Ang Mo Kio
3. Tai Seng


Our best model is:



The factor that most likely to affect the number of dengue case is:



Number of cases per fortnight to justify cost of fumigation = 25

### Recommendation
1.
2.
3. To engage fumigation service only when there are more than 25 cases per fortnight
